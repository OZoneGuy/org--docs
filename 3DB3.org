* Overview of DBMS

  Databases are systems that are responsible for managing data. While their data is still stored on secondary storage devices, they differ form regular “flat” flat files. For starters, they are not flat! The data is usually stored in some sort of tree structure for efficiency and speed. The structure is specialised for whatever *DBMS[fn:1]* is handling the file. While maintaining speed and efficiency, the DBMS must ensure the following properties:
  * *Concurrency*: multiple users can access the database simultaneously, while allowing the database designer to code it as if all transactions are done serially, not in parallel. As with any concurrent system that relies on some global state, this relies on a locking mechanism that stops multiple from altering the same data simultaneously to avoid data corruption or incorrect results.
  * *Maintain Data Integrity*: The goes for both the physical data and any constrictions the designer put on the data fields.
    * /physical Data/: The DBMS should be able to recover from a failed or an incomplete transaction. It does this by registering the transaction in the log *before* it is executed. In essence, all transactions are /atomic/. Meaning they are either successful or not successful. There are no partial transactions.
    * /Constraints/: These are data constraints. They define the domain of each field and whether the data is valid or not. They define the data type for the field and its properties. This can be some variable function or a constant one. Example, it can check if the new purchase or money allocation goes over the total budget for the project or simply check if a number is positive. It is responsible for cancelling the transaction and informing the user of the failure.
  * *Queries*: A DBMS should be able to run queries and answer questions about the database. Questions can be about the average salary in some faculty, the number of people who are born after a certain data, the shortest person, etc. Queries select and return entries/entities which satisfies certain properties. These queries can be over multiple tables and they are able to join records/entities depending on the command specified.


  Some important takes:
  1. Every object that is being read or written to is locked in either 'shared' or 'exclusive' mode respectively to ensure data integrity.
     * Shared lock allows reading but not writing by other processes, while an exclusive stops other processes from accessing the resource completely.
  2. A DBMS must be able to selectively force a collection of pages from the memory to storage. Some OS support is not satisfactory.
  3. Periodic checkpoints can make crash recovery easier and faster. But check pointing often slows down normal execution. So some balance is necessary.

** Structure of a DBMS

   The DBMS has at the top /Views/ as the interface. The exact format of the view depends heavily on the application. This can be a GUI or a CLI. The /View/ is responsible for providing the SQL commands/statements to the DBMS.

   Following is the /Query Evaluation Engine/. This takes the statements and prepares it for execution. The statement is first /parsed/ then potentially optimised for faster execution. Then it is turned to the /plan executor/, this is normally in the form of a tree of relational [[Relational Algebra][operators]]. These serve as the building blocks for any transaction.

   Then comes the /method layer/. This is where the concept of *file* is defined. In a DBMS, a file is usually collection of pages[fn:2] or records. *Heap* files, or unordered files are also supported. This is where the relevant page information is stored for requesting read and write.

   This sends requests to the /buffer manager/. This is where the pages are actually requested. It loads pages from storage to the memory as needed.

   Lowest but not last is /disk space manager/. You guessed it! It manages how the DBMS uses space on the disk. The higher layers use methods provided by this layer to allocate, deallocate, read, and write pages.

   To its side comes the /transaction manager/ and the /lock manager/. The former makes sure that the correct lock is applied by each transaction. A query only applies a shared lock, etc. While the /lock manager/ keeps track of all the locks.

   Lastly is the /recovery manager/. Recall that the DBMS keeps a log of all transactions. This module is what handles the logs and is also responsible for recovery after a system crash.

   The /buffer manager/ and the /disk space manager/ are what interacts with these modules.

   :TODO: Insert a diagram for the system.
** Levels of Abstraction in a DBMS

   There are 3 abstraction level to any DBMS; [[Physical Schema]], [[Conceptual Schema]], and [[External Schema]].
*** Conceptual Schema
    Sometimes called the /logical schema/, the conceptual schema describes the stored data in terms of the data model of the DBMS. In a relational DBMS, it describes all the relations and entities in the database. The example the book makes are students in a university; the students and courses are entities and the enrolment is stored as a relation.

    #+CAPTION: Conceptual Schema example for students and courses
    #+begin_quote
    Students(/sid:/ *string*, /name:/ *string*, /login:/ *string*, /age:/ *integer*, /gpa/: *real*)

    Courses(/cid:/ *string*, /cname:/ *string*, /credits:/ *integer*)

    Rooms(/rno:/ *integer*, /address:/ *string*, /capacity:/ *integer*)

    Enrolled(/sid:/ *string*, /cid:/ *string*, /grade:/ *string*)

    Meets_In(/cid:/ *string*, /rno:/ *integer*, /time:/ *string*)
    #+end_quote

    Looking at the previous scheme we can identify that *Students*, *Courses*, and *Rooms* are entities while *Enrolled* and *Meets_In* are relationships between these entities. The way we can see this is that *Enrolled* and *Meets_In* reference field names from the entities, while entities do not reference any already defined field names. *Enrolled* references /sid/ from *Students* and /cid/ from *Courses*.

    #+begin_quote
    NOTE: This referencing is done implicitly. This is dependant on the project syntax and how the designing teams agree on the syntax. Some form of explicit referencing could be deployed all the same, or different entities could have the same field name while not referencing each other.
    #+end_quote

    Arriving at any conceptual design is done iteratively. This process is referred to as /conceptual database design/.

*** Physical Schema

    The physical schema describes how these relations are stored on the physical storage. This decides the file organisation and creates an auxiliary data structure, called *indexes*, to speed up data retrieval operations. Again, this is an iterative process called /physical database design/.

*** External Schema

    This schema describes how the data is displayed and to whom. This allows us to customise what data is displayed and who has access to which data. For any DBMS, there is /exactly/ one Conceptual Schema and one Physical Schema, but there can be any number of External Schema tailored to each particular user/user group.

    The external schema creates views for the users. A view is essentially a relation, except that it is not explicitly stored physically, but it references already existing relations(and entities) in some convenient format.

    An example from the preview schema would be:
    #+begin_quote
    Math_Course(/name:/ *String*, /grade:/)
    #+end_quote

    This would be used to view all the students in some mathematics course. Notice that some vital fields are missing, /sid/ and /cid/. There are passed to create the view, but they don't necessarily show up in the final view. This information would be considered irrelevant to some users. If we want to show the /sid/ of each student then we can. We can also show the /cid/, but since in this example we are looking at one course there is no point in doing so

** Data Independence

   In essence, this concepts dictates that are insulated from changes to the way the data is structured and stored. This means that for external schema views, if the conceptual schema changed, can undergo some definition change to produce the same result. That is, assuming that there has not been a fundamental change and the data is essentially reorganised.

   This allows us to create user specific views and hide data from the user(don't confuse this with information hiding in software development), such as income, personal data, etc. This is called *logical data independence*.

   This in turn shields the users from the physical schema as well, how is the data stored physically. This is called *physical data independence*.

** TODO Set Operations

** Joins
   Joins are rather useful in relational algebra and is one of the most common ways to combine information from two or more relations.

   It can be technically be defined as cross product followed by selection then projection, but they are used far more than the regular cross product(this sequence is used so often it gets its own function!). Add to it the fact that cross product's results are far larger than any join, so it is very important that the implementation doesn't involve the cross product. This is done by applying selection and projection 'on the fly'. Hence all the love for joins.

   There are multiple varieties for join operations.

*** Conditional Joins
    This is the most general form of join. It takes a /join condition/, /c/, and a pair of relations as arguments and returns a new relation. This can be defined using a selection and a cross product as follows:

    $R ⋈_c S = σ_c (R×S)$ 
    
    Note the /c/ can, and usually does, refer to attributes of /R/ and /S/. The reference can be in the form of position or name, /R.4/ or /R.field_Name/.

*** Equijoin
    
    This is a special form of the previous join. In an Equijoin, we match equal fields. Something like this:

    $S⋈_{R.sid=S.id}R$     /Sometimes written as/ $S⋈_{sid}R$
    
    Notice that we are comparing the field on both relations. This has the side effect of unnamed fields in the final relation, since we don't know to which relation /sid/ belongs to.
*** Natural Join
    
    A natural join is a more extreme form of equijoin, equality is specified on /all/ fields with same name on /R/ and /S/. In this case, we write it as such:

    $S⋈R$
    
    Notice that it doesn't have condition specified. The equalities are implicit. Since there are so much of them, we don't bother writing them all down.
** Division
   
   The division operator is most useful for queries such as “Find all the students who enrolled in all the courses.” Knowing what it does exactly and how to define it using other operators is a useful exercise, but not necessary. Not as popular as the other operators. In fact, most DBMS don't even bother implementing it as a distinct method but leaves the user to rely on other operators to achieve the same result, unlike the join operator.

   So bear with me for a second, I need to go abstract for a bit. Imagine we have two relations, /A/ and /B/. Let /A/ have the fields /x/ and /y/ and /B/ have just /y/, which have the same domain as in /A/. $A ∈ ⟨x, y⟩$ and $B ∈ ⟨y⟩. Following so far? A division $A/B$ would be set of all /x/ values such that for *every* /y/ value in /B/ there is a tuple $⟨x, y⟩$ in /A/. $∀ y ∈ B ∙ (∃ x ∙ ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ A)$ this gives us the 𝑥s that satisfy this property. If you need to take your time or go for a walk to understand this feel free to.
   
   Division can be defined as:

   $π_x((π_x(A) × B)-A)$

 For examples regarding relation algebra see the book.
* Queries, Programming, Triggers
  
  #+BEGIN_COMMENT:
  The SQL language was developed by at IBM and was later adopted by many vendors. It consists of the following aspects:
  
  * *The Data Manipulation Language*

    This subset is responsible for and allows us to query and manipulate the data itself. Manipulation can be in the form of insertion, deletion, or modification of the 'rows' or entities.

  * *The Data d*

  #+END_COMMENT:
  
  Queries are what allows us to manipulate the Database, whether it be the stored data or the database structure itself. SQL is the most common language for database queries and is the focus of the book.
  
  We will be using the following table definition in our examples for SQL statements:
  
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE:
  Sailors(_/sid:/ *integer*_, /sname:/ *string*, /rating:/ *integer*, /age:/ *real*)
  
  Boats(_/bid:/ *integer*_, /bname:/ *string*, /color:/ *string*)

  Reserves(_/sid:/ *integer*, /bid:/ *integer*, /day:/ *date*_)
  #+END_QUOTE:
  
  The tables related to these deviations can be found [[http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/openAccess/thirdEdition/exercise_data/all_tables.zip][here]] as a zip file.

**  Basic Query Form

   Each /query/ has the following generic for:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     SELECT [ DESTINCT ] select-list
       FROM from-list
      WHERE conditions;
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Fist is the ~SELECT~ statement, which identifies it as a query, followed by the list of columns/fields to be retained or showed in the results. Next is the ~FROM~ keyword, which specifies a cross product of tables. Or more simply, followed by the list of tables to run the query on. Lastly is the optional ~WHERE~, where you can specify conditions on the selection.
  
  Such query can be easily represented in relational algebra.

  :TODO: Add algebra examples.
  
  Here is an example of a simple query.
  #+CAPTION: Find the names and ages of all the sailors.
  #+LABEL: Q:selectSailors
  #+BEGIN_SRC sql
    SELECT DISTINCT S.sname, S.age
      FROM Sailors S;
  #+END_SRC

  The result is a set of rows containing the fields /S.sname/ and /S.age/. If more than one sailor have the same name and age, the entry will only appear once. This is due to the ~DISTINCT~ keyword; if omitted we will get duplicate entries. Since there are no conditions, this is equivalent to the projection, /π/, operation in relational algebra.

  Another example:
  
  #+CAPTION: Find all the sailors with a rating higher than 7
  #+LABEL: Q:querSelSRating7
  #+BEGIN_SRC sql
    SELECT S.sid, S.sname, S.rating, S.age
      FROM Sailors AS S
     WHERE S.rating > 7;
  #+END_SRC
  
  This query uses the optional keyword ~AS~  which acts like a projection, $ρ$.
 
  When evaluating a query, SQL evaluates it in the following order:
 
  1. Compute the cross product of the tables in the *from-list*
  2. Delete rows in the cross product that fail the *CONDITION*
  3. Delete all columns not in *select-list*
  4. If ~DISTINCT~ is specified, eliminate duplicate rows
  
     
  This is basic recipe for SQL evaluation, but usually is inefficient. A DBMS doesn't usually evaluate as stated. But that discussion will probably come at a later date.

  #+begin_center
  More examples of queries can be found in the book.
  #+end_center
*** Expressions and Strings in the ~SELECT~ Statement

   Consider the following query:

   #+LABEL: Q:exprAndString
   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
     SELECT S.sname, S.rating+1 AS rating, R.day
       FROM Sailors S, Reserves R
      WHERE S.name LIKE 'John%';
   #+END_SRC

   We can see that in the *column-list* we have a mathematical expression and the use of ~AS~. SQL allows for expressions on column names or constants. It follows this structure: ~expression AS new_name~, where ~expession~ is any expression as described and ~new_name~ is the column name for the computed data. ~AS~ here serves as a projection, $ρ$. In this example we add 1 to the rating of all the sailors in the query and name the results *rating*.
   
   In the ~WHERE~ part of the statement we are comparing strings. For strings we can use the ~LIKE~ keyword when we want to use some wildcard, i.e we give part of the string the query will match it. Wildcards in SQL are ~%~ analogous to ~*~ in regex, and ~_~ which matches any one character.
*** Set Operations
    
    When evaluating queries we can make of use some set operations, such as /Union/, /Intersect/, and /Except/, or /set difference/. These operations match their definitions in Set theory.

    * Union format
      #+begin_quote
        QUERY_{0}
        /UNION/
        ...
        /UNION/
        QUERY_{n}
      #+end_quote
      
    * Intersect
      
      #+begin_quote
        QUERY_{0}
        /INTERSECT/
        ...
        /INTERSECT/
        QUERY_{n}
      #+end_quote

    * Set Difference (/Except/)

      #+begin_quote
        QUERY_{0}
        /EXCEPT/
        ...
        /EXCEPT/
        QUERY_{n}
      #+end_quote
      
*** Nested Query

    Since queries simply return a set of rows and their input is a set of rows, we can chain them. Or more accurately, /nest/ queries inside of queries. The nested queries can appear in the ~FROM~, ~HAVING~ (to be discussed later), or the ~WHERE~ clauses.
    
    We will be looking into the ~WHERE~ clause for now. To compare a condition using set queries we use the following keywords:

    * ~IN~ and ~NOT IN~

      This is analogous to the $∈$ and $∉$ operations.

    * ~EXISTS~

      As far as I can tell, this is exactly like ~IN~. Except for the fact that the query has to be reevaluated for each entry on the parent query.

    * ~ANY~
      
      This is usually used to compare the data to all the rows in the nested query. Returns true if there is at least one case where the condition holds. Analogous to $∃$.

      #+CAPTION: ~ANY~ example
      #+begin_src sql
        SELECT S.sid
          FROM Sailors S
         WHERE S.age > ANY (SELECT S2.age
                              FROM Sailors S2
                             WHERE S2.name Like 'Bob%')
      #+end_src
      
      This query return the id of all sailors who are older than any sailor whose name begins with 'Bob'.

    * ~ALL~

      Similar to ~ANY~ but the condition has to be met with all the returned rows in the nested query. Analogous to $∀$.
